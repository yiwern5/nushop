## Problem Motivation
At present, various transactions, including the sale of T-shirts and resale of used goods, are being conducted through disparate telegram channels. As a consequence, certain students may fail to avail themselves of the opportunity to obtain attractive and engaging merchandise from NUS clubs and societies, or secondhand items at reduced prices, due to their absence from these telegram channels.

## Aim
NUShop aims to create a common marketplace for NUS students, consolidating sales from different clubs and organizations. This platform celebrates the unique skills and passions of our student community, providing an opportunity for small business sellers to turn their ideas into reality and gain valuable entrepreneurial experience. Our multi-vendor app also features a dedicated space for second-hand sales, promoting sustainable consumption habits. We aim to foster creativity, innovation, and community spirit while supporting the financial and environmental well-being of our student community.
